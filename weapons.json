Any time during your target’s next turn, you can reel in the line and take the boost action as a reaction to any of its actions or movement, as long as your boost moves towards that target by the most direct route possible. Your target must then pass a hull save or be knocked prone, and this effect ends. The line snaps if your target teleports.",

Any melee attack that misses you in this stance forces the attacker to pass a hull save or become knocked prone.<br>Wind Stance: This weapon gains reliable 2, threat 2, and knock back 2.
